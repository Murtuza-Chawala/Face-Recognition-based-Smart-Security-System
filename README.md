# Face-Recognition-based-secured-login-system
### Prevent Unauthorized access to your machine by this amazing piece of code which will not allow any hacker to manually enter your system even if he knows your password using face recognition techniques along with whatsapp,mail and audiobot functionalities.

#### Walkthrough of this system
##### 1.) This system is activated every time the system is booted and uses face_recognition to identify whether the person trying to open the machine is you or someone else.
##### 2.) If it detects and recognises your face then an audio bot will welcome you and the system will close.
